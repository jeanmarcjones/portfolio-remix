## Who Am I

As a Front-End Developer with over five years of experience with **typescript**, I've specialised in the **React** and
**React Native** ecosystems. I'm fascinated by the power of these versatile libraries to enable seamless code sharing
across multiple platforms.

I love using technology to turn ideas into functional applications that solve real-world problems. Tackling the
challenges that arise during this process gives me a great sense of fulfilment.

## Work

I have been working for [CarePlanner][1] (now [Nourish][2]) for the past five years. CarePlanner provides care planning
software for residential and domiciliary care agencies. During this time, I worked on rebuilding the CarePlanner mobile
app. The app is an offline first **React Native** app with 40,000 daily active users. It enables care workers to access
their rotas, send messages and photos back to the office, get directions to their next appointment, download client
documents, view and administer medications, and clock in and out of appointments.

## Hobbies

I typically spend my free time enjoying life with my partner and playing with our cats. However, you might also catch me
cooking tasty food, exploring nature, attending live music events, or watching the occasional film.
