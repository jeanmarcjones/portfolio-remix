# Jean-Marc's Portfolio

My portfolio website made with the Remix framework.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Inspirations

While building this site I used the following repos as source of ideas and code.

- [Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack)
- [Remix Blog MDX](https://github.com/pcattori/remix-blog-mdx)

For more context you can read the [epic stack](/docs/decisions/001-epic-stack.md)
and [MDX routes](/docs/decisions/005-markdown-as-a-database.md) decision documentation.
