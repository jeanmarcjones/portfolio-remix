# Epic Stack As Inspiration

## Context

I've been developing React Native apps for the last five years and have had no time to keep up with the changing
landscape of React on the web. I built my previous portfolio before I knew React, so making a new one would be the
perfect project.

Kent C. Dodds' Remix template would be the perfect place to find information on Remix and web best practices. However, I
was hesitant to use it as I didn't have the time or money to complete its [instruction manual][1].

## Decision

The MVP for my portfolio requires a fraction of the features in the template, so using it would likely be overkill. I'll
use it as a reference and copy only the relevant code and ideas. This approach will allow me to understand how
everything works and give context for those decisions without having access to the course material.

## Consequences

While this approach might take longer to set up, it gives me a deeper understanding of using Remix to build modern web
apps.
