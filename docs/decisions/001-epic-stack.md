# Epic Stack As Inspiration

## Context

I've been developing react native apps for the last five years and have had no time to keep up with the changing
landscape for react for the web. I've need a new portfolio website for quite some time as my last one was written before
I learnt react. So this was the perfect opportunity yo kill two birds with one stone as it where.

I knew that Kent C. Dodds remix template "Epic Stack" would be the ideal way to be exposed to both remix and the webs
best practices, but I was reticent to use it as I didn't have the time or money to complete the instruction manual for
it ([the epic web course][1]).

## Decision

The MVP for my portfolio only requires a fraction of what is included in the epic stack template so using it would
likely be overkill.

I will therefore use the epic stack as a reference and only copy the code and ideas that are relevant. This will allow
me to gain a deeper understanding of how everything works and the reasons for the decisions made in the template without
having access to the course material.

## Consequences

Doing it this way will mean it takes me longer to get setup, but I will a deeper understanding of how to use remix and
build modern web apps in the process.
