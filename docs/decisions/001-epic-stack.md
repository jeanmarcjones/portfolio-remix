# Epic Stack As Inspiration

## Context

I've been developing React Native apps for the last five years and have had no time to keep up with the changing
landscape of React on the web. I've needed a new portfolio website for quite some time, as my last one was written
before I learned React. This was the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.

I knew that Kent C. Dodds' Remix template "Epic Stack" would be the ideal way to expose myself to both Remix and web
best practices. However, I was hesitant to use it because I didn't have the time or money to complete the templates
([instruction manual][1]).

## Decision

The MVP for my portfolio requires only a fraction of what's included in the Epic Stack template, so using it would
likely be overkill. I'll use the Epic Stack as a reference and copy only the relevant code and ideas. This approach will
allow me to gain a deeper understanding of how everything works and why decisions were made in the template without
having access to the course material.

## Consequences

Doing it this way will take longer to set up, but I'll gain a deeper understanding of how to use Remix and build modern
web apps in the process.
